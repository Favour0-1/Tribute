                <h2>About Late Akilo Agbebaku Micheal</h2>
                <p>
                    <h3>Late Akilo Agbebaku Micheal</h3> was a 400 level accounting student in the University of Benin.<br>
                     He was the Deputy Head of Department shorten as DHO of Counselling and follow-up Department in the Redeemed Christian Fellowship (RCF UNIBEN/UBTH).<br>
                     He is such a diligent worker in the house of the Lord. He is a young Leader conversant with the word of God, he is a peaceful and gentle being<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Late DHO Agbebaku always encourage counselling and follow-up department to be active in following up their counselees,<br> even he thought us a code which is
                    "48 120 2", that is 48hours(2 days), 120hours(5 days) and 2weeks(14 days).<br> The code is a guideline to communicate with our counselees, within 48hours, we should have reach out to our
                    counselees once <br> within 120hours, we should have called twice and pay a visit once and within 2weeks, we should have called at least thrice and pay them visit twice.<br> The essence of the code is to 
                    ensure there is a close relationship  between us the counsellors and our counselees, for them to be able to open up to us.

                    Late DHO Agbebaku is also a teacher, he thought during the baptismal class<br> He is never tired of answering my cumbersome biblical question.<br>
                    His death was so shocking and painful to me,<br> we just embarked from a journey of 8months ASUU strikes and after three or four weeks of resumption <br>
                    just for him to write his final exams, sign out and become a graduate, he was announced dead.<br> Though his death was painful but a profitable one because he
                    lived a fulfilled life.<br> His death wasn't mourning but a rejoice that a soul has been added to the kingdom of heaven.
